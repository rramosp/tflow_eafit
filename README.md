# TensorFlow study group at EAFIT

Meetings every Thursday 6pm - 8pm @ EAFIT **ROOM 7-102**

## Group 1: Learning TF

will follow [EdX Deep Learning Google Tutorial](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730). Other useful course for background or reference is [EdX Machine Learning Fundamentals UCSanDiego](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSanDiegoX+DS220x+1T2018/course/)

## Group 2: Solving a problem

Must choose one or a few problems to address with TF deep learning techniques. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) is a good source of inspiration to choose a problem to address. Other interesting sources and background information:
